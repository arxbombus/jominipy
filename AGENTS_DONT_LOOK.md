Activate project `jominipy`

We are going to implement our roadmap now.
Read the memories, then the relevant documentation and code, including docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/BIOME_PARITY.md, docs/NEXT_AGENT_ROADMAP.md. Tell me your proposal
Use serena and smart-tree agentic tools appropriately

Proceed with the implementation, keeping in mind that Biome parity is of utmost importance (so you should read biome's code when relevant)

Please update our reference_map memory so the next agent will have a much easier time with implementation of the next phase.


Are we done with the phase yet? Do we need to update any relevant documentation and memories including docs/NEXT_AGENT_ROADMAP.md for the next agent? Is there anything in the roadmap that you find is out of sync with biome or our architecture and goals?
